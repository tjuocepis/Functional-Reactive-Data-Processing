# Reactive Functional Program For Streaming And Analyzing User And Book Data #

### Have to fix bugs when hitting user-data endpoint. If server response error then all concecutive user-data responses give two all user
### responses instead of one for all and one for specific user. Must implement error handling when a user only contains ratings of 0
### Something with the counter is messed up.

### Must also write code to send the rated books sequence to the actors and back to the endpoint
### Would also like to implement combining book ratings data with book information data such as title and etc.
